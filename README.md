# Optimisation
This project is made to implement Mathematical optimization (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization) into a DLL library and also bring the user interface to interact with the said library.

Features:

-Optimisation of the N-dimentional functions

-Function parser with basic math functions and constants (log, exp, pi, etc.)

-Automated testing that generates an excel file

-5 Built-in optimisation methods

-20 Built-in functions for testing

-User interface with material design
